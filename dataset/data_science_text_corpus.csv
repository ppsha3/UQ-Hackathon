210,"UTS Faculty of Engineering & Information Technology / UTS Future Mobility Lab   The UTS Future Mobility Lab, sitting within the Data Science Institute has applications open for a scholarship opportunity for talented and highly-motivated students to study how to use data science and machine learning problems to solve transportation and smart city problems. Opportunities are anticipated to commence in January 2021.   The project is “A.I. for traffic and congestion management” and it is calling for applications for a PhD scholarship under the supervisory team of Dr. Simona Mihaita and Distinguished Professor Fang Chen. Candidates with strong research track record including publications in transport/civil engineering, computer science, mathematics and relevant disciplines are encouraged to apply. Previous research experience in statistical machine learning, optimization and deep learning is a plus.     Project description: Managing traffic represents a true challenge for all traffic centres around the world, especially under an ever growing urban population living in cities. The increased traffic congestion is linked to an increased data availability from transport modes in the city, whether it is regular or public transport, shared or on-demand services, electric scooters, etc.   This PhD project aims to study and apply various Artificial Intelligence algorithms and build a smart modelling framework that would help manage traffic across all available modes in a city, under both regular and disrupted traffic conditions (incidents/public events/travel restrictions due to pandemics, etc.). This implies to a combination of multidisciplinary research from computer science and transport modelling.   The first part of the PhD will focus on conducting an intensive state-of-art usage of AI techniques for managing transport across the globe, followed by the construction of a modelling framework on a real-city study. This will be alimented by the best performing machine and deep learning models to predict traffic congestion and travel patterns across all travel modes in advance. While recurrent traffic modelling back-up by AI can provide good insights on traffic patterns, incidents/public events or temporary travel restrictions are stochastic events which have unique features changing dynamically in time.   The second part of this project will aim at extending the modelling framework for early anomaly detection across all transport modes which can help to release early traffic alarms to operators for taking action.   The last part of the PhD will consist in consolidating results and writing up the PhD thesis.   About the Scholarship  This work is funded under the ARC Linkage Project LP180100114, a joint collaboration between UTS, Data61, Swinburne University of Technology and 2 major universities in Singapore: NUS (National University of Singapore) and NTU (National technology University of Singapore).   Regular meet-ups and workshops will be organising for presenting new findings and to learn from new techniques applied both in Australia and Singapore. Domestic students are highly encouraged to apply.   Scholarships are available for high quality applicants. The scholarship is $33,000 AUD per year for three years.   About you  Demonstrated self-motivation and commitment to work on challenging research topics Demonstrated experience in undertaking research in the fields of computer science, transport engineering or automatic control Excellent written skills evidenced by scientific journal papers, conference papers, or technical reports Excellent interpersonal and oral communication skills Ability and capacity to implement required health and safety policies and procedures Master Degree by research or First-Class Honours with strong academic record Major: Computer Science, Civil Engineering, Mathematics Domestic students or international students (meeting UTS English Proficiency requirement)   Our vision is to be a leading public university of technology recognised for our global impact.

Opportunities are anticipated to commence in January 2021.   The two projects connected to the AAII is calling for applications for Ph.D. scholarships under the supervisory team of Distinguished Professor Jie Lu. Candidates with a strong research track record including publications in computer science, mathematics, and related disciplines are encouraged to apply. Previous research experience in statistics, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning is a plus.     Project description In this area of research, we offer two high-profile projects:   Drift learning for decision-making in dynamic multi-stream environments  This project aims to provide application-ready real-time decision support systems for big data situations. Real-time support for organisational decisions is crucial in fast-changing environments that are highly dependent on data from multiple large streams. Unforeseen changes in data distribution (drift) are inevitable. The ability to learn drift in dynamic environments with multiple large data streams will benefit innovation and decision quality in challenging data situations.   The project will have wide applications, such as in cybersecurity, telecommunications, bushfire control, and logistics. The project will advance machine learning knowledge, providing a foundation and technologies to support real-time decision-making in big data environments.   Sequential Decision-making in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments  Current machine learning and optimization methods cannot well support sequential prediction and decision-making due to the dynamic nature and pervasive presence of big data.   This project aims to create a foundation and technology for sequence and uncertainty learning, sequential and dynamic optimization, and their integration.   It is expected to improve robustness and mitigate the vulnerabilities of machine learning algorithms, to increase prediction accuracy and reliability in dynamic sequences, and to support decision-making in complex situations to achieve robust and adaptive results.   Anticipated outcomes can help data scientists with state-of-the-art skills to manage sequential data and benefit data-enabled innovation in Australia.   About the Scholarship  The potential candidate should be self-driven and motivated, should have an Australian PR or citizenship, and a university degree in Computer Science or a comparable discipline.

320,"UTS Faculty of Engineering & Information Technology / Centre for Audio, Acoustics & Vibration   The  Centre for Audio, Acoustics & Vibration, sitting within the School of Computer Science has applications open for multiple scholarship opportunities for talented and highly-motivated students to study high-quality and original data science, and biophysics/ bioacoustics problems. Opportunities are anticipated to commence in January 2021.   The two projects connected to the Vibration Laboratory is calling for applications for PhD scholarships under the supervisory team of Dr Sebastian Oberst and Dr Benjamin Halkon (and CAAV colleagues). Candidates with a strong research track record including publications in acoustics (engineering and physics), biophysics or engineering physics and relevant disciplines are encouraged to apply. Previous research experience in material science and biology (biotremology, bioacoustics) is a plus.     Project description: Termites live in colonies of several million individuals, underground and in the dark. The substrate termites feed and live on is biogenically designed or modified to serve as a multifunctional, multi-scale material. Termites use this substrate to efficiently ventilate and air-condition their nest, to carry a maximum of load by using a minimum of materials, as food storage, nursery or for the defence of the colony and as a communication channel. Yet, almost no details of how these different functions are achieved are known.   Biotremological communication channels of biogenic, multi-functional materials  This project interfaces Mathematics/Computer science with Engineering to engage pattern recognition and machine learning tools to understand the combined effects of the communication channel as a multifunctional structure with various signalling types (walking, foraging, alarming). The goal is to transition the findings into the design of novel, topologically optimised signal filters, leading to engineered highly efficient, lightweight multiscale metamaterials for the construction and manufacturing industry.     Vibro-acoustic cloaking of biogenic structures in a host-inquiline relationship in termites (Project B) This project directly interfaces Biophysics with (Acoustic)Engineering to study a specific tri-trophic relationship of a certain ant species (predator), termites (prey, host) and inquilines (prey, parasite) and its nonlinear dynamics, but with focus on communication networks. The focus is here on studying the communication network characteristics and its species interactions (eavesdropping etc) by using the ‘active space’ concept of biology/biotremology and to relate this to the behavioural ecology of termites, their predators and competitors. Using the network and its input/output relations using theoretical considerations and experimental data, novel vibroacoustic materials for camouflage are sought to be conceptualised, specifically for defence applications.   About the Scholarship  The potential candidate should be self-driven and motivated, should have an Australian PR or citizenship, and a university degree in Engineering, Physics or Mathematics or a comparable discipline. This work is funded under an ARC Discovery Project. Scholarships are available for high-quality applicants. The scholarship is $28,092 AUD per year for three years (top-up scholarships of up to $10k p.a. for domestic students can be arranged).   About you  Demonstrated experience in undertaking research in the fields of physics, biophysics and engineering, desirable in vibrations and acoustics; Demonstrated knowledge of data analytics, desirable experience in machine learning and pattern recognition' Excellent written skills evidenced by scientific journal papers, conference papers, or technical reports are desirable; Demonstrated self-motivation and a strong work commitment (for challenging research topics); and A Masters by Research degree or Bachelor degree [Engineering or Science] with the strong academic record (eq. to 1st Class Honours); and An interest to work with insects and to work in a strongly interdisciplinary team to generate scientific impact and bridge engineering with science.

411,"Most of us have someone in our lives struggling with addiction and that’s ok. Whether it’s hidden, or visible, you have probably seen the difficulty in staying on the path of recovery and how patchy support can be for those striving to stay on track. That’s why we founded Aurelius. Aurelius will change the nature of addiction recovery. We want to give people with addiction, and their families another option beyond rehab programs that costs tens of thousands of dollars. Recovery from is a lifelong process, and Aurelius is building the support that family members and clinicians often struggle to provide on their own. It takes a village. Weare connecting people fighting addiction to the worlds largest ecosystem of support. Get to know our vision and us as founders a little better in our recent Demo Day pitch which you can watch here What is it like at Aurelius right now? We have just received VC funding to make sure we can focus on execution over the next couple of years instead of worrying about job safety. The interest in health tech is huge right now, and we are tackling a new frontier just at the right time — a digital therapeutic for a chronic disease which people can access any time, anywhere.  Make no mistake — we’re not just building a simple app. We are not competing with other apps as much as we are helping people win the fight against ‘bugs’ in the human brain and the chemical substances that exploit those bugs. To win that fight, people need to be connected to an ecosystem of support and get recognised for every positive step they take in their recovery journey. That means completely normalising the process for people thinking about seeking help, educating friends and family on how best to support and deploying that education in a way that gets people to think about Addiction as a chronic disease. We are actively working with the people who are struggling with addiction, as well as customers — namely treatment providers and health insurers. Our MVP launched a few months ago and has validated a bunch of assumptions, and our first pilot with a large organisation has been lined up. We are also involving researchers and experts in the process as addiction is a complex problem, and we want to prove the efficacy of our solution. We are building a small team to build Aurelius from scratch, and we will create the culture and ways of working together. That’s right, you get to be part of building this company from the ground up. Success is when Aurelius marketing feels like this: “Come and use Aurelius for lifelong addiction support — it’s not a big deal, it’s normal” The role:  In short: A bit of everything. This is a hands-on role where you take the lead on the next stage of marketing at Aurelius. B2B partnerships have been set up and there is a fair bit of work to do before our launch later this year to get our channels partners ready to refer their patients to us. You will own this from scratch. The website, one-pagers and socials all need attention. Content and copywriting will be your core competency to help share the amazing stories of our members fighting addiction. You will have our full support to get creative with your storytelling. As someone who is forever curious and thinking about the big picture, you will probably think out of the box with our online versus offline journey. Find the audience and optimise the best vehicle for them. ie video, story, humour, facts. Experience with email marketing and managing socials will be vital. This will help us run experiments. learn fast and find the best direct to consumer channel(s) Everything we do at Aurelius is backed by research and science, this does not stop at marketing, Marketing based on data will be something we value. Help us define our brand and build it from the ground up by listening to people with Addiction and SEEING what resonates with them across each channel. Be self-starting and proactive with the team. The Founders are NOT marketing peeps (They are Sales and Product masters) so you will need to clearly articulate “the why and how”. Manage and own relationships with BD’s of Facebook and Google to quickly figure out our-constraints with legal so our ads don’ get cancelled. Yes, marketing in Health is a little tricky so you will have to be creative. Ideally, what are we looking for in you? This is where other companies tell you how many years of experience you need to have, that they want you to have a certain degree from certain universities bla bla ego. We don’t — because we don’t think how old you are and where you’ve been says anything about your competency. Instead, we are looking for someone who will enjoy a culture that promotes and rewards:  Curiosity: You have dabbled in various marketing tactics. You will own the problem and solution and have the experience to master your craft including support from the founding team to lead the direction of the marketing strategy. You are numerically driven but can draw more than a stick figure. We have an awesome product designer to help you make things look pretty but you also know what good looks like. Passion for helping people: You love helping and empowering others — either by taking the time to pass on what you know, as a manager, mentor or instructor, or by giving up your time for others — to help a friend, or to support a good cause. All of us at Aurelius feel the same way, then we want to make a positive contribution to the world around us, so others don’t have to face and figure out tough issues alone. Openness: You probably hate politics and prefer just having frank conversations with people. You are comfortable with sharing the lessons you learned the hard way, and never judge others for their missteps. At Aurelius, we ask our users to be open — and we don’t expect more from them than we expect from ourselves. Bonus: We started as a remote company and are open to candidates anywhere — as long as you are able to make yourself available for conversations with the team during the day, Sydney time. You can expect from us.  You will enjoy working with us at this early stage if you are autonomous, like fast-paced environments and prefer open and direct communication. If you prefer to get given clear instructions and need a manager who develops your craft skills, we are not quite ready for you yet. Flexible working arrangements in exchange for a culture that is not ‘9 to 5’ in practice. Additional Work from home budget to ensure we get the best out of you. Wherever you are. Stand-up desk, additional screen, good lighting or even some comfy shoes. Last but not least: Addiction is a problem that touches every part of society — no matter what gender, racial background, sexual orientation, or religious belief. That’s why we are building a team that is just as diverse as the people affected by addiction. We hope this ‘letter’ instead of a stock-standard JD gives you a bit of a feeling for us. Now, would like to hear from you; What connects you to the problem? Where are your strengths and gaps in building a new health-related app from scratch? And how do we get the best out of you as our teammate? PLEASE APPLY THROUGH THE LINK BELOW: You will not hear back from Aurelius unless you complete the video interview.  https://start.myinterview.com/aurelius-health/content-marketer-2 HERE for our initial screening interview.

Every year in Australia there are around 950 new children diagnosed with cancer. To improve the outcomes of children with cancer, the Children’s Cancer Institute (CCI) initiated the Zero Childhood Cancer national personalised medicine trial (PRISM). This trial aims to match patients to the optimal treatment guided by molecular tumour profiling, high-throughput in vitro drug testing on patient-derived model systems and in vivo drug validation in patient-derived xenograft models. The Bioinformatics group at CCI plays a crucial role in unravelling and understanding the molecular basis and drivers of a child’s tumour and is essential for the integrative analyses to link molecular profiling data to in vitro generated drug efficacy data for drug hit calling and prioritisation for individual PRISM patients and the identification of novel biomarker-drug efficacy associations for future patients.
As a key partner of the Zero Childhood Cancer program, the Translational Tumour Biology (TTB) group at CCI is deeply involved in the molecular profiling and drug analysis of the program and focusses on further understanding how altered genes drive cancer and on how to translate this knowledge into new clinically applicable treatment interventions. The TTB group believes that understanding the molecular mechanisms used by cancer driver genes is the key to more effective therapies with reduced toxicity.
Currently, we are looking for a strong and creative programmer with an eye for detail and a passion for biological research to:

Analyse high-throughput drug screening data within the PRISM trial
Develop an integrative data analyses platform for dynamic correlations between in vitro drug efficacy data and molecular profiling data

Perform benchmarking analysis of software and develop and optimise key pipelines
Contribute to the bioinformatics education of other researchers.

The bioinformatician will be embedded within the Translational Tumour Biology research group, while strongly interacting with and being fully supported by the Bioinformatics group. This unique position not only offers the opportunity for the candidate to develop new analysis approaches and make new informatic discoveries, but also to create own research questions.
 
Responsibilities will include, but are not limited to:

Develop and optimize algorithms to analyse, visualise and summarise in vitro drug efficacy data generated within the national PRISM trial to support drug curation meetings in which drug screening results are shared and discussed with treating clinicians and other team members involved
Develop an integrative data analyses platform for dynamic correlations between in vitro drug efficacy data and molecular profiling data
Develop and implement algorithms using omics data and in vitro efficacy data to predict effective drug combinations
Support spin-off research projects resulting from the precision medicine program
Support research projects and grant administrative activities of the Translational Tumour Biology group
Statistical analysis for clinical and bench-side research
Assess, understand and implement bioinformatics tools and generate bioinformatics pipelines
Teach, assist and mentor scientists in the field of bioinformatics
Any other tasks required by the team leader or delegated senior team members

520,"The Graduate Research School, Faculty of Science, Agriculture, Business and Law at The University of New England has a range of scholarship opportunities available. We are looking for two highly motivated PhD students interested in working as part of an interdisciplinary team to conduct research in either of the following areas:  The extent and impact of goat mortality and its causes in smallholder production systems in Laos, and how disease control can be integrated into the production system Production and socio-economic characteristics of smallholder goat production systems in Laos, and how improved nutritional practices can be integrated into the production system Understanding the current and future demand for live goats and goat products from Vietnam and Laos, the associated factors and the characteristics needed to meet future demand The successful applicant must have a relevant background in veterinary, animal sciences or agricultural economics and desirably, knowledge of smallholder production systems in South-east Asia and small ruminant disease, parasitology, nutrition or marketing. This project is hosted by UNE in collaboration with partner institutions in Australia, Laos and Vietnam. Although based at UNE in Armidale, NSW, the student will be required to conduct field work in Laos and/or Vietnam.   Laos remains a predominantly agricultural society where over 75% of families engage is smallholder farming. These families typically grow rice and crops to sustain themselves, and raise small numbers of livestock for manure, draft power, a financial safety net, and for occasional consumption. In particular, goats have recently increased in importance with national goat numbers growing more than fivefold between 2000 and 2016 from 30,700 to 157,000. A scoping study (LPS/2016/027) identified increased demand for goats from Vietnam as a significant contributing factor. This presents a valuable opportunity for Lao farming families to enhance their income, particularly because Lao goats receive a price premium of up to 30% over Vietnamese crossbred goats. However, the sustainability of goat production remains uncertain, with goat mortality ranging from 10% to 80%, seasonal and long term scarcity of feed occurring and the current and future markets for goats being poorly understood. The two PhD candidates will work towards solutions within one these overarching issues: goat disease, goat nutrition or goat marketing. The successful candidate will be involved in field-research involving survey data collection, may be involved in laboratory research, and developing extension and training tools. The students will be required to perform statistical analysis and communicate research findings in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. The scholarship is available to Australian students only and covers tuition and stipend. The stipend scholarship value is AU$$30,000 p.a. over three (3) years. The level of stipend will not be reduced over the period of the scholarship. The scholarship is tax exempt and paid fortnightly. Applicants must meet UNE’s admission requirements for a PhD program which can be found here. The application form and supporting information are available at the webpage  apply/enrol for candidature.

We particularly welcome applications from people with lived experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities.

671,"Forensic Pathologist
This is a rare opportunity for an experienced forensic pathologist with a strong research background to join the Forensic Pathology team at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (VIFM) to help bolster the Service's academic strengths and credentials.
Forensic pathology is the speciality that focuses on the investigation of death. Our forensic pathologists undertake a range of examinations of deceased persons to determine not only the cause of death, but critically, the person's identity, the external and internal factors (genetic or inherited conditions) contributing to the death and the reconstruction of the circumstances (both physical and social) in which the death occurred.
Forensic pathology is perhaps best understood by the community because of its role in the criminal justice system in relation to homicide investigations. However, this only represents about 1% of our work today. The largest part of a forensic pathologist's role is to be a public health specialist and to help identify preventable deaths in the community. We work with families, courts and other health practitioners providing information that contributes directly to the prevention of deaths or injury in the community. As part of this work, we identify disease and predisposition to disease that has important ramifications for the ongoing health of families.
You will be a part of the Forensic Pathology team responsible for medicolegal death investigations in Victoria and elsewhere. This requires working closely and collaboratively with the Coroners Court of Victoria (CCoV) by taking a leading role in the initiation, triage and completion of cases, including attending scenes of death and specialist inspections and autopsies. You will maintain your professional medical and technical standards and work closely with the rest of the pathology team in teaching, training and research initiatives. A strong research pedigree is key to this role.
Please note, the salary and conditions for this role are in line with the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (Specialist Forensic Pathologists and Physicians) Agreement 2018.  The range is between level one to level six with the starting salary being $295,690 per annum from 1 September 2020. 
Who We Are
As an institution focussed on forensic medicine, we serve the community and the courts. Our statutory responsibilities are to provide independent forensic medical and scientific expertise to the justice system, tissue for transplantation, and to both teach and undertake research that will benefit the community.
The Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (VIFM) provides the justice system with the crucial evidence that underpins safe convictions and appropriate acquittals. Our doctors and scientists investigate deaths reported to the Coroner, examine alleged offenders and medically assess and support victims of crime.
The Donor Tissue Bank of Victoria (DTBV) supports patients and their families by providing safe tissues to medical specialists and Victorian hospitals for transplantation and medical research.
Our medical and scientific staff members undertake research that directly contributes to public health and safety and the just working of our legal system. By contributing to the professional development and education of forensic pathologists, physicians and scientists, we ensure a high standard of forensic medical services for Victoria and provide critical support for our healthcare and justice systems.
